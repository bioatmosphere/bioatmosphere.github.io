      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about creating a blog for a while to write about my research. Many providers out there are pretty cool to use. For example, wordpress is one that are fairly popular among people of many industries. And i am actually using such a platform (&lt;a href=&#34;https://bwangecology.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/documentary-of/amp/&#34;&gt;https://bwangecology.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/documentary-of/amp/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is served as a tutorial for building a personal website using Hugo and the Academic theme hosted on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many website builders analogous to Hugo are out there. Here i choosed Hugo because of its popularity in academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;academic-theme-for-hugo&#34;&gt;Academic theme for Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular themes in academia for building a personal website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1&#34;&gt;Step 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have Hugo installed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a GitHub account ready and either Git or GitHub installed on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2&#34;&gt;Step 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly create two git repositories both remotely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork the Academic Kickstart repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a repository named &amp;lsquo;yourname.github.io&amp;rsquo; (replace yourname with your own actual GitHub account name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then clone these two repos to your computer locally.
Open a terminal and type the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/bioatmosphere/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>My paper entitled “Soil aggregates as biogeochemical reactors and implications for soil-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases: a concept ” was eventually accepted by Global Change Biology at the onset of November, 2018 [1]. It is really not easy to get this good outcome. So, I just want to write this post as a documentary of the production of this paper, telling some stories ‘behind the paper’. In detail, first of all, i would articulate the central idea of this paper and its broad implications (if it has, hopefully) in a fairly broad context.</description>
