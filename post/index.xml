      <description>I have been thinking about creating a blog for a while to write about my research. Many providers out there are pretty cool to use. For example, wordpress is one that are fairly popular among people of many industries. And i am actually using such a platform (https://bwangecology.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/documentary-of/amp/)
This post is served as a tutorial for building a personal website using Hugo and the Academic theme hosted on Github.</description>

      <description>My paper entitled “Soil aggregates as biogeochemical reactors and implications for soil-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases: a concept ” was eventually accepted by Global Change Biology at the onset of November, 2018 [1]. It is really not easy to get this good outcome. So, I just want to write this post as a documentary of the production of this paper, telling some stories ‘behind the paper’. In detail, first of all, i would articulate the central idea of this paper and its broad implications (if it has, hopefully) in a fairly broad context.</description>
